Developed wireframes and prototypes using design tools such as Sketch and Figma.

Conducted user testing to validate the design and identify areas for improvement.

Developed the web application using web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Integrated payment gateways and reservation functionality to facilitate transactions.

Deployed the web application to a hosting service such as AWS or Heroku.
